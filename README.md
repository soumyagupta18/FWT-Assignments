### Case Study:
    We want to create a simulation of the movie booking system for specific theatre. This system
    will be operated by the operator himself, he will be making booking against customer. The
    objective of the system is to manage the booking for multiple screens, adding shows for the
    screen and designing the seating arrangements as per the categories (premium, silver and
    gold).
    As per the movie booking request by the customer, operator should be able to check the
    availability of the seat in category choice of user. Operator should be able to get the seat
    availability and reports like, Collection report & shows report.
